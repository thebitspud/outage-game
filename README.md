# outage-game
This is a Java Swing game that I intermittently worked on between Aug. 2017 and Mar. 2018<br>
I do not plan on ever returning to this project (though I may reuse the concept in a future game)<br>
This means that all the fun and exciting bugs you experience will be there forever.<br><br>
To play, download and run the .jar file<br>
The gameplay guide, item/mob/upgrade glossaries, and some other stuff are in the Player's Manual (accessible from the menu)
